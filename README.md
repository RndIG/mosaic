# Mosaic

Mosaic will be a pet project I'll be using to learn Java.

This endeavor will be more about journey than destination, 
main focus of project is to get knowledge, 
so I expect sometime to choose path not necessary most efficient or conventional, but with clear logic of getting new (for me) skills or train some techniques.


I will start with just retrieving weather data from free API, then processing it in some form and depending on said data gaining result which would be +/- indicator.
### TODO list
- Class that will be calling API, considering call frequency limitations
